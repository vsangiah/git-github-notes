Important stuff in this course: 
Core git, Next level, Collaborating, Advanced - maybe Unnecessary

Start:
GIT - version control system, does everything like perforce

How to Visualise this:
1) add checkpoints for any set of files (repos)
2) go back in time to that checkpoint
3) fork and have a different time line and thay could meet with the first timeline

Scientists use git + Github for code and theses

git - offline, local to the machine vs Github - web service for hosts repos

Configuring Git:
git config user.name
git config user.email
git config --global user.name "Venkatesh"
git config --global user.email venkat2797@gmail.com

GIT REPO: workspace with files and folders and history
Have a master folder - cd into the folder and init git there - now this is a repo
# to get history of the repo 
git log


# get status of a git repo
git status

# navigate to the folder and initialise a repo
git init
# creates a .git dir in that folder and it has all the details of various versions
# delete this .git dir, then all version data will be lost
# make sure you are not intiializing a git repo inside a subfolder of an existing repo
# so always get the status first before issuing the git init cmd 

# its good to set a default branch name - this is what the repo starts off
git config --global init.defaultBranch "main"

# or u can specify the name of the brach yourself
git branch -m "firstTry"

## COMMITTING - a commit is equivalent to a checkpoint in the devlopment process
# it is a snapshot of all changes in a repo
# Work on stuff -> Add changes to as many files as required -> Group these changes into sets and add a label -> Commit each of it individually ->| now you have a check point

# Committing is of two stages: git add (to club the changes) and git commit (send it to repo)
# There are three locations:
# 1) Working Directory
# 2) Staging Area
# 3) Repository
# git add issued from the working dir, stages the changes
# git commit issued after staging, commits the changes to the .git ie the repo
# to add all the untracked changes, use . instead of file paths 
git add file1.extn
git add file2.extn file3.extn
git add .
# issue git status to see what changes are added and what are untracked

# Two ways to commmit - issue the git commit with/without the message
# Without -m, issuing git commit will open a text editor and ask for a message
git commit
git commit -m "added new files for XYZ and deleted ABC"

# log command: to display the commits timeline -
# Shows three things: 
# 1) commid hash a369f9f682851937bf25cf2e0a159f9190d0af94
# 2) Author, Date
# 3) message for that commit
git log

# Some Sensible Stuff: SSS
# 1) Atomic Commit - single feature or change or fix - so that it is easier to rollback
# 2) Use a Present-tense imperative stype of message for each commit: 
# 	message shall be like giving orders to git or the computer
# 3) If message is multiline detailed explanation: inline -m "message" is not feasible
# 	so just give git commit and it will open the default editor, in my case it is nano
# 4) To change the default editor
git config --global core.editor "vim"
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
git config --global core.editor "pluma"
# 5) If we give along multi-line message, git log will give a long message as well.

# How to ammend a commit:
git commit -m "sample msg"
git add forgotten_file.extn
git commit --amend

# How to ignore insignificant/secret files that is usually tracked by default:
# Eg. Secret files, API keys, credentials, OS system files, insignificant log files, dependencies and packages that get built like slprj
# 1) create a REPO_ROOT/.gitignore file and add the files and folders you want to ignore
#	you can use wildcard
touch .gitingnore
# edit this file and add line by line names and folders you would like to ignore
# Refer https://gitgnore.io  to know what all you would be needing to ignore and 
#	just copy paste and save your time
